Here i have uploaded some Blender files I have created whilst following beginner tutorials and will upload more as i learn.
thes files can easily be exproted into Unity for Example, see my other repository ( https://github.com/D4N-W4TS0N/Learning-Unity ) , by using these insrtructions:

blender files can be easily exported into Unity by: File >> Export >> Export as FBX >> then choose the assets folder of your Unity Project. 
However please bear in mind this may differ if you are usingthe newer?older version of Blender/Unity. 
Make sure to highlight the objects you want to export, NOT the camera or light etc. 
Then, when choosing a folder to export to, click the box labeled "export highlited items" or "highlited items".
